Welcome to my STAT 441 - Classification Final Project for Fall 2025.
Group members include:
* Darren Alexander Lam Kin Teng
* Ojus Udagani
* Raghuv Bansal \n
This GitHub repository contains my submission for the final project on my model implementation. It holds the project notebook, coded in Python, and the dataset `astro_dataset_maxia`, gathered from Kaggle (Link below).

The task was to develop a CNN model to predict 12 astrophysical classes. I implement a pre-trained model, VGG16, and use transfer learning for the project's purpose.
