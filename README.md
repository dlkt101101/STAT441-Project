Welcome to our submission for STAT 441 - Classification Final Project (Fall 2025).
Group members include:
* Darren Alexander Lam Kin Teng
* Ojus Udagani
* Raghuv Bansal

The goal of this project was to implement 3 CNN models to predict 12 astrophysical classes based on image data, where each group member was responsible for a model implementation. The models implemented include VGG16, ResNet50 and a custom-built CNN.

This GitHub repository contains each member's Python Notebook named in the following format `ModelName_Member`. 

Due to the data folder being too large, the dataset `astro_dataset_maxia` was not uploaded to the repo and can be downloaded from Kaggle (Link below).

In each notebook, the `astro_dataset_maxia` folder was downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded to our personal Google Drive. The Google Drive folder was then used as the data source for the project.
